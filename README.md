# hello-world
Hello World! project: I am learning how to work on GitHub.

I am a new programmer who is learning how to code Python,
in order to conduct data analysis.
I have reached a point in my study where I thought,
"I should probably get on GitHub and create a
repository for this code."
So here I am, learning how to make and commit changes
to a branch, opening a pull request, and merging branches.
